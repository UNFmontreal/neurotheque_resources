Developer helpers
-----------------

This folder contains small helper scripts used while developing and maintaining the repository.

- generate_config.py: scaffolds example configurations for quick iteration.
- export_repo_to_xml.py: inventories repository files into XML for audits.

These tools are not part of the library runtime and may change without notice.
